UX perspective 

User stories, as an important part of the UX design, are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, 
usually a user or customer of the system. In a random order a list of important user stories has been drawn up bellow: 

	As a prospect, I want to know what kind of website I’m looking at directly when I will open the webpage (at first); 
	As a prospect, I want to see clearly what kind of services Nortstack delivers. I’m expecting to see relevant information without searching through the website; 
	As a IT recruiter, searching for projects for clients, I want to see what kind of people are behind this digital agency, I want to see relevant information about services and people. 
	As the co-owner of the company, I want to use the website as an digital business card. I need the website to be in line of the corporate identity, and also be available for good use of mobile devices (responsive design); 
	As a customer of Nortstack, I want to find some contact information about the company, i.e. email-addresses and location of the office.

Testing

Various methods have been used to test the website. During development, the programmers continuously tested the operation of the software. 
This is done by checking the correct functionality of the code on different screensizes, different resolutions, different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). 
This approach is used from the start to the end of the realization of the project.

Mockups and sketches were also used to continuously build and deliver in accordance to the initial plan and design of the website.
In the final phase of the project, the opinion of a number of people was asked. We used IT and creative professinoals and also people with a less direct affinity to 
the perspective of Nortstack's website. The following questions are asked enduring the review of the website. 

Is it clear what purpose the website has?
Is it easy to get in touch with Nortstack?
Is the website logical?
What do you notice?
What improvements can you recommend?


The group of testers were approached at three times to do a check on the website. This was roughly divided into the following moments:

- Halfway through the project, because there is still room for further development
- By the end, to remove any bugs
- After the final delivery, to be able to check whether the starting points that have been conceived beforehand correspond with the practice.
