UX perspective 

User stories, as an important part of the UX design, are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. In a random order a list of important user stories has been drawn up bellow: 
	As a prospect, I want to know what kind of website I’m looking at directly when I will open the webpage (at first); 
	As a prospect, I want to see clearly what kind of services Nortstack delivers. I’m expecting to see relevant information without searching through the website; 
	As a recruiter, searching for projects for clients, I want to see what kind of people are behind this digital agency, I want to see relevant information about services and people. 
	As the co-owner of the company, I want to use the website as an digital business card. I need the website to be in line of the corporate identity, and also be available for good use of mobile devices (responsive design); 
	As a existing customer of Nortstack, I want to find some contact information about the company, i.e. email-addresses and location of the office.  
In the following link you can find additional information concerning the UX/UI design. This includes wireframes and mockups: www.nortstack.com/background/ux/
